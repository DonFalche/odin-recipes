    <p>Milanesa napolitana is a variation on the breaded fried steak called milanesa that is popular in Argentina and
        Uruguay. Milanesa a la Napolitana does not originate from Milan or Naples; it's thought to have been invented in
        the 1940s at a Buenos Aires restaurant called &#8220;N&#225;poli&#8221;.</p>
    <p>Milanesa napolitana is similar to veal parmesan, but with South American touches. After the steak is breaded and
        fried, it's topped with a slice of ham, tomato sauce, and melted mozzarella cheese, and served with french
        fries. Leftovers make great sandwiches, especially when paired with a soft but crusty roll. </p>
